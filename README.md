# BBC-Angular-project - BEER WORDS
An angular project to get beer inspiration based on abstract words.

Words and data come from a custom-built json file and can easily be updated to work with any content.

Angular project created from scratch and all work my own unless stated in the comments.

I apologise for the silly content - I had originally planned to make something useful with real beer tasting notes and beer profiles but I realised it was going to take me too long to write all content together.

thanks!
